[The ETL(Extract-Transform-Load)] process is a key component of many data management operations, including move data and to transform the data from one format to another. To effectively support these operations, spark-etl is providing a distributed solution.

spark-etl is a Scala-based project and it is developing with Spark. So it is scalable and distributed. spark-etl will process data from N source to N database.
The project structure:

**Extract**

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/26BRIuiQfAxf5cENO/giphy.gif" alt="alt text" width="250" height="250">

  - FILES (json, csv)
  - SQLs
  - NoSQLs
  - Key Value Stores
  - APIs
  - Streams

**Transform**

  - Row to json
  - Row to csv
  - Json to Row
  - Change records
  - Merge records

**Load**

  - FILES (json, csv)
  - SQLs
  - NoSQLs
  - Key Value Stores
  - APIs
  - Streams

**Pros**
  - parallel ETL on cluster level
  - synchronisation
  - open source

Example scenario to use spark-etl:
We want to get data from multiple sources like MySQL and CVS. When we extracting data, we also want to filter and merge some fields/tables. During the transform layer, we want to run an SQL. Then we want to write the transformed data to multiple targets like S3 and Redshift.

spark-etl is the easiest way to do this scenario!

### How to become a committer

Want to contribute? Great!

Committers have write access to the projectâ€™s repositories, i.e., they can modify the code, documentation by themselves and also accept other contributions.

There is no strict protocol for becoming a committer.

Being an active committer means participating on [gitter] discussions, helping to answer questions.
Of course, contributing code and documentation to the project is important as well. A good way to start is contributing improvements, new features, or bug fixes. You need to show that you take responsibility for the code that you contribute, add tests and documentation, and help to maintain it.

If you would like to become a committer, please write on [gitter].

### Development

spark-etl uses Scala and Apache Spark for distributed developing.

Minimal requirements:

- Support for Scala (scala plugin)
- Sbt (sbt.version = 0.13.12)

### Todos

 - Scalafmt integration
 - ETL Design
